This personal project was born after I kept having the same problem when cooking. Whenever I make something that tastes good (which is not that often :) ) from recipes I collect (blogs, recipe sites, cooking magazines I find in kids center, ...), there was no simple way for me to save them. Oishikatta (美味しかった) meaning "It was Yummy" in Japanese, is just an easy way to store my own recipes, adding ingredients and steps smoothly in a single click.

I used Symfony3 for the backend and a little bit of Vuejs with Twig for the frontend. I run it for free on Amazon Aws on their free tier offer. It is open source (link) so anybody can use it and there is a whole documentation on GitHub (link) on how to run it by yourself.
