Based in the west of Lyon - France, JLP Electricité started as an electrician company more than 30 years ago. Recently they evolved to provide a wider range of services including sustainable energy and green mobility. They needed a brand new website to match their business and services expansion. Using Asp.net MVC 4, I developed their new website which explains thoroughly what they do and details their projects.
