When I thought about how to make the site you are currently checking, I wanted to focus on two things mainly :

- Making me learn a lot of things (framework, pattern, â€¦)
- Having a fast website (and nice looking but all credits to the designer, not me)

Despite making some test projects and reading a lot about ReactJs I never had the occasion to use it in a real-life project. By using GatsbyJs (which is based on ReactJs) to generate this static site, I could meet these requirements. With real projects (and not just tests or tutorials) you run into real problems that you can't just avoid. I wrote more thoroughly in the blog about the creation of this site and, as it is open-source, how to remake it step by step. The project is on [github] too.
