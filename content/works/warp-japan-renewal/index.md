### Clients and Needs

In 2021, the web agency WarpJapan needed to renew their corporate's website. They liked their ongoing website but needed to display more information about their projects and about their culture.
They trusted me to build find solutions for both frontend / backend and to integrate their animated new design.

### Aesthetics

From the organic shape, they used rounded elements and big typography to bring a dynamic, fun and modern feels.

### Story & Content

For better insight, they displayed their showreel as the introduction.
They believe that every client and project is unique. On the new website, case studies, processes, and results of their works have a bigger place.

### Details & interaction:

- A new way to represent the hamburger menu. The interaction of the four vertical lines comes from the letters themselves.
- Smooth scroll
- Page transition on portfolio
- Floating typography background

### Development

WarpJapan's main focus for their new website were :

- Dynamic and modern animations
- Easy to maintain
- Fast

With all this in mind, I chose to develop it using Nextjs with an headless CMS (Prismic) to manage data.
Nextjs allowed to create beautiful transitions while having the power of Server Side Rendering and Static Generation of pages to make it blazing fast. The simplicity of editing content on Prismic also helped them to make the transition from the previous website (back office and frontend were on the same platform).
