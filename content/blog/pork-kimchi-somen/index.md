### Tips

I found this recipe in a cookpad magazine, it's easy and great for summer.
Somen as a cold dish are great during the hot japanese summers.
After cooking and rinsing somen, you can add them to a large bowl (or the pot you've just used to cook them) with water and ice cubes. It helps keeping them very cold and they taste even better.
