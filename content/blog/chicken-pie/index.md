### Instructions

1. Cut the chicken in big slices ann sprinkle salt and pepper on it.
2. Heat a frying pan with olive oil and add the chicken. Add a small piece of butter on top.

3. Cut the spring onion in small pieces (about 1-2cm) and add them to the pan. Add some thyme and nutmeg if you have.
4. Do the same with the mushrooms (in slices) and add them to the pan.
5. Add the heap table spoon of heavy fresh cream, a heap tea spoon of flour and a heap tea spoon of mustard. /!\ if you don't have cream you can replace it with yoghurt instead and add a bit more flour to make up. Add the yoghurt add the end when everything is cooked, yoghurt doesn't like to be heated /!\
6. Add 300ml of Chiken stock (of make it with 鶏がらスープ)
   Mix well eveything
7. Add everything to an oven pan and cover it with a puff pastry. Fold the pastry on the sides and make a chimney in the center. You can add some thyme on top.
   You can paint with an egg yolk for a beautiful color.
8. 200ºC for 15-20 minutes

### Tips

An easy chicken pie, you can put a pie sheet on top only or use two, one under and one on top.
If you don't have an oven pan (like me), just transfer your cooked chicken with sauce to an ovenproof dish.
