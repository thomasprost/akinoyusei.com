ingredients:
  - 2 pie sheets. I buy the frozen ones at supermarket. Usually they are square shaped and small so I mixed small pie sheets to make a normal one.
  - 2 eggs
  - 100g of almond powder
  - 70g of soft butter (not melted just a bit soft to help making the dough). Depending on your microwave, but usually 20s to 30s is enough. Or leave it outside of fridge a bit before making the dough.
  - 100g of sugar
  - 1 tbsp. of flour
  - _Optional_ 1 tbsp. of rhum or kirsch
  - _Optional_ 50g of pastry cream (Recipe here. I don’t always add it when I have no time and it’s still good without.)
  - _Optional_ A bean or lucky charm and crown to pick who will be the king. I think plastic ones melt in oven so you can add porcelain figure if you have or add it after cooking the pie.

### Instructions

1. Beat one whole egg and one egg white with the almond powder, soft butter and sugar. The
   yolk will be used to make the galette kirei :)
2. Add the flour and the selected alcohol
3. The cream we’ve made is called frangipane. If you make pastry cream too, add it to the
   frangipane and put it in fridge for 30min to have it very cold.
4. Spread out the first pie sheet and spread the cream on it leaving an edge all around. I use a
   tart dish to cook it mostly because that’s all I have and it’s easier for me.
5. Brush the edges with a bit of water.
6. Cover it with the second dough and press the edges with fingers for pies to stick together.
7. Mix the left egg yolk with a bit of water and spread it on the pie so that it will look golden after
   cooking
8. Put the pie in the fridge for the 30min
9. 200°C in oven for 25min
   You can serve it warm or cold.

### Tips

- Use cold pie sheets and frangipane cream
- If no time to make pastry cream, it’s ok it’s still delicious.
- You can draw on the galette before cooking it, use your imagination (or Google image)
- If you find it’s too fat, reduce the butter and sugar
- Cooking in japan can be tricky (even more for cakes) because some ingredients are difficult to
  find or crazy expensive. For example, all-purpose flour isn’t common or very expensive so try
  different kinds and adjust. (https://illmakeitmyself.net/resources/guide-to-flour/)
- Experimenting with other ingredients is always fun (but not always oishii  )
- This galette is great with macha or Yuzu.
