### Introduction

Apples, like many fruits (except bananas maybe), are expensive in Japan. Of course it really depends on the season and on where you buy them but usually I only buy 1 or 2 apples at a time. It spend a good five minutes checking every fruits and it always seems like an big investment to me :) Though sometimes when I buy a bag of 4, 5 apples, they are floury and are not very good to eat. Then I make crumbles :) .
Frozen fruits are pretty cheap and easy to find. You can make this recipe with apples only or add mixed frozen berries / frozen mangoes.

### Instructions

1. Peel and cut apples into dice.
2. Precook them in a pot with a bit of water, sugar and lemon juice. If you don't have lemon juice, don't add it.
3. Once soft, remove from fire and let it cool down.
4. Add the berries to the pot and mix well. You can also add berries separately to have two distinct layers of fruits.
5. Pre-heat oven to 180Â°C.
6. In a large bowl, add sugar and flour. Mix well together.
7. Cut the butter into cubes and add them to the flour / sugar mix.
8. Mix with your hands to get a sandy texture. Don't mix too much, your hands will melt the butter and you want to keep some big pieces in the mix.
9. In a baking pan, add fruits and the batter on top. Cook for 25 minutes.
