### Why making your own pie

In Japan it's not easy to find pie sheets and when you find some, there are not always very good. They tend to be frozen (never found a fresh one like we have in every supermarkets in France) and of small rectangle shapes (usually a pack of 4 sheets) so anyway you'll have to roll out 2 rectangle sheets together to make a pie. This recipe is a light (using yoghurt to replace most of the butter) and easy (it can take hours to make a real puff pastry, waiting between each fold). This intro has way too many parenthesis ごめんね。

### Instructions

1. In a mixing bowl, put the yoghurt, cover with flour, add the butter in big pieces and finally the salt.
2. Mix well with your hands but not too much so that the butter doesn't melt. The butter shouldn't become liquid.
3. Make a ball.
4. Add flour on your kitchen counter and on your rolling pin. Spread the dough to be about 30 cm long and 15cm large (twice longer that large).
5. Fold this rectangle in 3 : Fold the lower part on the middle one and then the top one over.
6. Turn it 45° left like a book (not a japanese book :) ), the big side on the left.
7. Repeat previous steps 5 times to get five layers in your pastry (or more if you want)
8. Keep in fridge for 30 minutes before using or freeze it.
